XSokoban 3.0
------------

This is the third release of XSokoban.

This distribution contains all the files to compile and run the game,
the original 50 sokoban screen files, 40 additional screen files
gleaned from various public domain versions of sokoban, and a manual
page that explains how the game works.

Installation -
  - Edit the header files config.h and config_local.h to define the
    appropriate paths and compilation options for your system.
    These defines should be checked carefully to make sure they are
    correct.

  - Use 'xmkmf' to produce a Makefile from the Imakefile provided, or
    else edit 'Makefile' to set the compiler and compiler flags correctly
    and select the right libraries to compile with.

      - If you want to have the game run in color, you will need the
	XPM library. In this case, make sure that in the previous step, the
	option EXTRA_INCLUDES points to the directory containing
	"xpm.h", and that EXTRA_LIBRARIES references the directory
	containing the library "libXpm.a". Last time I checked, XPM
	could be obtained by FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib. Make
	sure your version of XPM is up to date. The current pixmaps
	were produced for version 3.2g.
    

  - Compile by typing 'make'.  If something goes wrong, and you can track
    down an error, send me a bug report (including what changes you needed
    to make, and I will see about fixing it for later distributions).

  - Play the game by typing 'xsokoban'. If it complains about not being
    able to read the scorefile, create one with 'xsokoban -c'. If this
    doesn't work, it is probably because you need to create the score
    directory. See config.h.

  - Set ROOTDIR to the desired location for the xsokoban data files,
    and rebuild.  Install the game by typing 'make install' or by
    manually copying the executable. Install the directories screens/,
    scores/, bitmaps/, and saves/ under ROOTDIR.

Notes -
  - The screen files need to be publically readable and should not be
    writable.

  - The score file should be readable/writeable ONLY by the 'superuser' of the
    program (see config.h).

  - The save files should be readable/writeable ONLY by the 'superuser'.

  - Because of this, the game needs to be run setuid of the person who is
    'superuser'.

Credits -
  Unknown Hacker - Original curses(1) implementation.
  Joseph L. Traub - X windows interface.
  Kevin Solie - simultaneously developed X implementation (merged in).
  Mark Linderman, Christos Zoulas - Mouse code (added to Solie's version).
  Andrew Myers - Improved mouse UI and score ranking

Fixes/Bug Reports/Modifications -
  - If you make any changes to this program, fix any bugs, add any neat
    features, or whatever, please send mail to "andru@lcs.mit.edu"
    so that I can add them in to the newest release.
