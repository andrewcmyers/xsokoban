XSokoban 3.0
------------

This is the third release of XSokoban.

This distribution contains all the files to compile and run the game,
the original 50 sokoban screen files, 40 additional screen files
gleaned from various public domain versions of sokoban, and a manual
page that explains how the game works.

Installation -
  - Edit the header files config.h and config_local.h to define the
    appropriate paths and compilation options for your system.
    These defines should be checked carefully to make sure they are
    correct.

    When you're bringing the system up, it may be useful to set
    ROOTDIR="." in config.h. This will allow you to test the program
    while saving score files under the build directory.
  
  - Edit Makefile to set the compiler and compiler flags correctly, and
    select the right libraries to compile with.

  - Compile by typing 'make'.  If something goes wrong, and you can track
    down an error, send me a bug report (including what changes you needed
    to make, and I will see about fixing it for later distributions).

  - Create the scorefile by typing 'xsokoban -c'.  (If you have a sokoban
    game already on your system, you should be able to just use that score
    file by setting the config.h defines correctly). If you can't create
    a new score file, it's probably because the necessary structure
    under ROOTDIR doesn't exist.

  - Play the game by typing 'xsokoban'.

  - Install the game by typing "make install" or by manually copying
    the executable. Install the directories screens/, scores/,
    bitmaps/, and saves/ under ROOTDIR.

Notes -
  - The screen files need to be publically readable.

  - The score file should be readable/writeable ONLY by the 'superuser' of the
    program (see config.h).

  - The save files should be readable/writeable ONLY by the 'superuser'.

  - Because of this, the game needs to be run setuid of the person who is
    'superuser'.

Fixes/Bug Reports/Modifications -
  - If you make any changes to this program, fix any bugs, add any neat
    features, or whatever, please send mail to "andru@lcs.mit.edu"
    so that I can add them in to the newest release.
