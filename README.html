This is the second release of XSokoban.

This distribution contains all the files to compile and run the game,
the original 50 sokoban screen files, 35 additional screen files
that were sent to me as being gleaned from various public domain
versions of sokoban, and a manual page that explains how the game works..

Installation -
  - Edit the header file config.h to define the appropriate paths, and
    things for your system. Nearly EVERY define in this file MUST be
    changed if your game is to run correctly.

  - Compile by typing 'make'.  If something goes wrong, and you can track
    down an error, send me a bug report (including what changes you needed
    to make, and I will see about fixing it for later distributions)

  - Create the scorefile by typing 'xsokoban -c'.  (If you have a sokoban
    game already on your system, you should be able to just use that score
    file by setting the config.h defines correctly).

  - Play the game by typing 'xsokoban'.

  - Have fun.

Notes -
  - The screen files need to be publically readable.

  - The score file should be readable/writeable ONLY by the 'superuser' of the
    program (see config.h).

  - The save files should be readable/writeable ONLY by the 'superuser'.

  - Because of this, the game needs to be run setuid of the person who is
    'superuser'.

Fixes/Bug Reports/Modifications -
  - If you make any changes to this program, fix any bugs, add any neat
    features, or whatever, please get ahold of me at jt1o@andrew.cmu.edu
    so that I can add them in to the newest release.

Future -
  - I will be setting up a sokoban level designer sometime in the near future.
