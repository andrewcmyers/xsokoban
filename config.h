/***********************************************************************
   Configuration variables for xsokoban

   You may wish to alter the directory paths, particularly ROOTDIR.

   Note that the string concatenation performed below requires an
   ANSI-standard preprocessor. If you don't have one, you'll have to
   manually edit SCREENPATH, SAVEPATH, etc. to start with ROOTDIR.
***********************************************************************/

/* HERE: Your local domain. This string will be appended to every user
   name that is sent to the WWW sokoban server, in order to avoid collisions.
   Change it!

   For example, if you are at Stanford, a good value for HERE would be
   "@stanford.edu". Making HERE specific to individual machines is a
   bad idea.

   Usernames that are specified through the "xsokoban.username" resource
   do not have HERE appended to them.

   In order to create your own WWW xsokoban score server, a few small
