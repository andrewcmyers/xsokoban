 XSokoban 3.2d 
 -------------


This distribution
contains all the files to compile and run the game,
the original 50 sokoban screen files, 40 additional screen files
gleaned from various public domain versions of sokoban, and a manual
page that explains how the game works.

Installation


    Edit the header file config.h to define the
    appropriate paths and options for your system.  These defines
    should be checked carefully to make sure they are correct. 


	
	You can compile xsokoban in either WWW mode or local mode.
	Where it stores scores depends on the mode. The mode is
	controlled by the WWW option; see "config.h" for
	more details.

    
	If compiling in WWW mode, make sure you change the variable
	HERE to refer to your location! 


Do one of the following (A,B, or C) to produce a Makefile:

  
      A. (Easy) Run the script "configure" to produce the include file
	"config_local.h" and a Makefile.

 
      B. OR: Edit "config_local.h" by hand, and use "xmkmf" to
        produce a Makefile from the Imakefile provided.
	
  
      C. OR: Edit "config_local.h" and "Makefile" by hand to set the
        compiler and compiler flags correctly and select the right
	libraries to compile with. 
    

	If you want to have the game run in color, you will need the
	XPM library. In this case, make sure that if you used options B
	or C, the variable EXTRA_INCLUDES points to the directory
	containing "xpm.h", and that EXTRA_LIBRARIES references the
	directory containing the library "libXpm.a". 

	Last time I checked, XPM could be obtained by FTP from
	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib. Make sure your version of XPM is up
	to date. The current pixmaps definitely work with versions 3.2g
	and 3.3, but not with version 2. They should work with version 3.4,
	too. 


    Compile by typing "make".  If something goes wrong, and you can track
    down an error, send me a bug report (including what changes you needed
    to make, and I will see about fixing it for later distributions). 

    Some systems have non-ANSI X header files, and you will need to
    turn off function prototypes in those headers, or get better header
    files.  You will know this is happening if reams of errors start
    popping up in "Xlib.h" 


    Play the game by typing "xsokoban". If it complains about not being
    able to read the scorefile, create one with "xsokoban -c". If this
    doesn't work, it is probably because you need to create the score
    directory. See config.h.


    Set ROOTDIR to the desired final location for the xsokoban
    data files, and rebuild.  Install the game by typing "make install" or by
    manually copying the executable. Install the directories screens/,
    scores/, bitmaps/, and saves/ under ROOTDIR.
